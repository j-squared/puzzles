### Sam’s Scrumptious Sweets

<details><summary>Hint 1</summary>
<p>

Solve the equations at the bottom of the recipe, where each letter represents one digit. 
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Hint 2</summary>
<p>

For B: B is a single digit, so it must be a value between 0-9. Experiment with different values for B until the equation becomes true.

For A, G, and F: Consider what number added to itself yields a final digit of 0. Set this to A, and figure out what numbers G and F must be for the equation to hold true.

For C and D: Remember that C and D are individual digits. Try out a few values and look for any patterns.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Hint 3</summary>
<p>

Pay attention to the line under the recipe title and read the recipe to determine how to transform some of the amounts.

</p>
</details>
 
<details><summary>Hint 4</summary>
<p>

Once you have solved the equations, A = 5, B = 6, C = 3, D = E = 1, F = 2, G = 9. Based on the recipe, how should you transform some of these values?

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Hint 5</summary>
 <p>
  Because the recipe calls for freezing A, B, and F for 15 minutes, adding 15 to these values gives: A = 20, B = 26, C = 3, D = E = 1, F = 17, G = 9.
